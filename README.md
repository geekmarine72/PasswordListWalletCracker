# PasswordListWalletCracker
Attempts to decipher a given wallet.aes.json using a password list

Note, when you need to get the pycrypto library to run. (easy_install pycrypto). 

I am not sure this even works.  It's a fork of code that claims to be able to decipher a wallet.aes.json blockchain wallet backup.  I intend to create a new wallet with a new password to confirm. 

Created in an effort to recover the password from a 4+ year old bitcoin wallet (with .55 BTC in it).
